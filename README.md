## Introduction
This is a repository to store all the information required in order to setup a macbook.
It contains all my required homebrew applications and dotfiles
and it contains scripts required in order to symlink the dotfiles and install homebrew apps.

## Setup
First, clone this repo and make sure it is located in the root user directory.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JacobR95/mac-setup.git ~/setup && cd ~/setup
```

Then, you need to allow your mac to run the shell scripts.

```shell
chmod -R +x ./
```

Then just run the setup script
```shell
./setup.sh
```
